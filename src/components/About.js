        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I’m a passionate Web Developer who loves building modern, responsive, and user-focused websites.

          I specialize in crafting clean, efficient, and scalable web solutions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, backed by Node.js and Express for seamless backend integration. My goal is to turn ideas into elegant digital experiences that look great and perform flawlessly across all devices.

          Whether it’s developing from scratch or optimizing existing projects, I’m driven by creativity, attention to detail, and a desire to deliver results that make an impact.

          Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new web technologies, improving performance techniques, and continuously learning to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech world.</p>
